# lagrange_interpolation

The goal with Lagrange Interpolation Theorem is that you can enter ANY numbers and you'll find a polynomial whose the curve will pass through those points.

Algorithm where you need to type (several times for more accuracy) 2 numbers ('a' and 'b') in IR such that P(a) = b and then enter a number 'a' to find its image: 'b'

For example: let an unknown polynomial P such that P(a) = b where (a,b) is in R²
you'll enter for example a = 2 and b will be 4; a = 5 then b = 25 and so on...
then when you'll enter any number it will return its squared version ( like -1.20178 it will return (-1.20178)² )
